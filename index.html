            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>I am a native Oregonian and have lived in the Portland area for most of my life. I attended <strong>West Linn High School</strong> and then went on to study biology at <strong>University of Oregon</strong> before transferring to <strong>Portland State University</strong> to study physical activity and exercise.<br/>I've worked for the <em>Portland Electric Boat Company</em>, renting out their boats and providing minor upkeep and maintenence. I've also worked for the <em>Stein Oil Company</em>, managing, supervising, and doing bookwork for their gas stations and convenience stores. Most recently I've worked as a real estate agent for <em>Premiere Property Group, LLC</em>.<br/>I decided to take a coding bootcamp because I've always enjoyed computers and how they work. I like working through problems and being able to see immediately if a solution works or if it affects something else in an adverse way, so I think that coding is a great field for me to go in to.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>One of my main interests has always been playing various sports. My first love is basketball, but I also really enjoy: running, biking, combining the two and competing in duathlons, wakeboarding, wakesurfing, and getting out in nature to hike or camp.<br/>Like many people, I really enjoy travelling. I have been to <span class="travel">Canada</span> and <span class="travel">Mexico</span>, some countries in western <span class="travel">Europe</span>, a few small <span class="travel">islands in the Pacific</span>, <span class="travel">New Zealand</span>, and <span class="travel">South Korea</span>. I will always look forward to the next new exploration that comes my way!<br/>I am a very easygoing person and I think that I am able to get along with all types of people. During my time as a real estate agent I greatly improved my attention and listening skills. I had to listen intently about what a client's wants and needs were and make sure that any small detail wouldn't go unnoticed.</p>
