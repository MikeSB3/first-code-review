              <p>I am a native Oregonian and have lived in the Portland area for most of my life. I attended West Linn High School and then went on to study biology at University of Oregon before transferring to Portland State University to study physical activity and exercise.<br/>I've worked for the Portland Electric Boat Company, renting out their boats and providing minor upkeep and maintenence. I've also worked for the Stein Oil Company, managing, supervising, and doing bookwork for their gas stations and convenience stores. Most recently I've worked as a real estate agent for Premiere Property Group, LLC.<br/>I decided to take a coding bootcamp because I've always enjoyed computers and how they work. I like working through problems and being able to see immediately if a solution works or if it affects something else in an adverse way, so I think that coding is a great field for me to go in to.</p>
